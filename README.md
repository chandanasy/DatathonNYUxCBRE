### Project Repository Overview
# Repository Contents:

BingAPI_.ipynb: Utilizes Bing Maps API code to extract aerial satellite imagery of specific locations using latitude and longitude coordinates.
Models(1).ipynb:
Implementation of Model 1: Simple CNN Model
Architecture: Consists of a convolutional layer with 32 filters (3x3), ReLU activation, MaxPooling (2x2, stride=2), and an output layer predicting 5 classes.
Training: Uses Adam optimizer, Cross-Entropy Loss, trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 10.
Performance: Achieves an overall accuracy of 67%, with the best class performance for 'Concrete Pad'.
